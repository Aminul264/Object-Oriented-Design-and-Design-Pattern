<h1>PetCare Management System</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I have implemented PetCare Service Management which defines an interface PetCareService and two concrete service classes, GroomingService and BoardingService, representing specific pet care services.

The PetCareManagementSystem class maintains instances of these services and provides methods to list available services and simulate performing a selected service on a pet.

In the main method, it demonstrates listing available services and performing a service on a pet.</p>
